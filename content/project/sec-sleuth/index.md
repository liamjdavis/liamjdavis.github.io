SEC Sleuth is a web interface designed to efficiently retrieve and present data from SEC filings, specifically the 10-Q and 10-K forms available through the EDGAR database. The application leverages a RAG fine-tuned on Microsoft Phi-3.5 Mini to provide accurate and contextually relevant information from these financial documents.
