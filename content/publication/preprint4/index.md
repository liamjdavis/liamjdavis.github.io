abstract: The St책lmarck procedure is a  method for checking tautologies in propositional logic, known for its industrial applications in hardware verification. Despite its theoretical importance, the practical implementation of the algorithm presents significant optimization challenges. This paper explores enhancements to the  St책lmarck procedure by integrating modern SAT solving techniques.

We make optimizations in the form of clause learning and directional heuristics on the St책lmarck procedure for boolean satisfiability. This research explores how modern SAT solving techniques can enhance the classical St책lmarck algorithm, making it more practical for industry applications.
