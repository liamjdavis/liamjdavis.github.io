abstract: In this paper, we introduce StalmarckSAT, the a modern re-implementation of the Stålmarck Procedure for SAT solving, and present two novel strategies to improve the Procedure, Cardinality Driven Branching (CDB) and Deductive Priority Ordering (DPO). CDB is a heuristic to improve branching with the dilemma rule, and DPO intelligently orders simple rules based on their deductive potential. Our results demonstrate improved solve times with both strategies.

We develop an open source modern re-implementation Stålmarck procedure for boolean satisfiability, and explore two strategies in CDB and DPO to improve the performance of the procedure.
